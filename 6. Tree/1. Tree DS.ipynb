    "* A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. It has a single root node and every other node is connected by a single path from the root.\n",
    "\n",
    " --------------------------------------- \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Root: \n",
    "* The topmost node of a tree, which doesn't have any parent. It is the starting point of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Node:\n",
    "* An element of a tree, which contains data and may have references to other nodes (its children).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Edge:\n",
    "* A connection between two nodes in a tree. Each edge connects a parent node to a child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Parent: \n",
    "* A node that has one or more child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Child:\n",
    "* A node that is directly connected to another node (its parent).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Leaf:\n",
    "* A node that does not have any children. It is the end point of a branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Subtree:\n",
    "* A tree that consists of a node and all of its descendants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Depth: \n",
    "* The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Height: \n",
    "* The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf.\n",
    "* The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Binary Tree:\n",
    "* A tree in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Balanced Tree:\n",
    "* A tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by no more than one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. Binary Search Tree (BST): \n",
    "* A binary tree in which the left child of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key, and the right child only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. Traversal: \n",
    "* The process of visiting all the nodes in a tree in a specific order. Common types include in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. Ancestor: \n",
    "* Any node that is higher in the tree hierarchy (closer to the root) relative to a given node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descendant: \n",
    "* Any node that is lower in the tree hierarchy (further from the root) relative to a given node."
